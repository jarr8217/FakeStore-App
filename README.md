# Fake Store App

This is a Fake Store application built using React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The app provides a mock online store experience, allowing users to browse products, view details, and manage their shopping cart. It demonstrates the following concepts:

- **Component Composition**: Modular and reusable React components.
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions like adding items to the cart and removing items.
- **API Data Fetching**: Fetching product data dynamically from an external API.
- **State Management**: Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage application state.

## Features

- User can browse products and view detailed information about each product.
- Dynamically fetches product data from a mock API.
- Allows users to add and remove items from their shopping cart.
- Displays the total price of items in the cart.
- Provides a responsive and user-friendly interface.

This project helped reinforce best practices in React development and CSS styling.
